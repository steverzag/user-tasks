# UsersTasks

This is a simple and modular .NET Aspire Web API project designed to manage Users and their associated Tasks. Built using .NET Aspireâ€™s application model, it serves as a base template for testing features, building proof-of-concepts (POCs), or experimenting with modern cloud-native patterns in a clean, structured environment.
